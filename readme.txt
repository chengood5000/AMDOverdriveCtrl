Notes:
------

This project is developed by using the "codelite" IDE (www.codelite.org).

	AMD Display Library >= 3.0 
	(http://developer.amd.com/gpu/adlsdk/Pages/default.aspx) 

	extract the ADL Library into the main project folder and rename the ADL
 	folder to "ADL_SDK" 

	wxWidgets 2.8.10 or later
	If you install the "codelite" IDE you will probably have all what's
	necessary.

Building and installing:

	'make && make install'

Uninstalling:

	'make uninstall'

Creating deb package:

	'make deb'

Creating source tarball:

	'make dist'
